# Sean's second_cerebrum
Loosely organized using Tiago Forte's [PARA](https://fortelabs.co/blog/para/) method.

## Linking my thinking
Links to related pages are placed up top using `[[this notation]]`. [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/) (my preferred notes app) understands this notation & generates a "knowledge map" of all linked notes, encouraging intellectual "cross-pollination".

## Design
Notes are all in markdown format. `![images]` render in Obsidian - I've tried to convert to text whereever possible. If the file size is too big, don't pull the Archive/Images dir. The notebook will still be very useful even without the images.

I am constantly adding/revising this notebook - be sure to refresh regularly!

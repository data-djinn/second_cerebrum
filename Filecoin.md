# Intro
==distributed storage network based on a blockchain mechanism==
- miners elect to provide storage capacity for the networkand thereby earn units of the Filecoin cryptocurrency (FIL) by periodically producing cryptographic proofs that certify they are providing the capacity specified
- enables parties to exchange FIL through transactions recorded in a shared ledger on the Filecoin blockchain
- rather than using POW to maintain consensus, Filecoin uses **proof of storage**:
	- a miner's power in the consensus protocol is proportional to the amount of storage they provide to the network
- Filecoin blockchain also implements the
#### **Filecoin VM**
==replicated state machine which executes a variety of cryptographic contracts and market mechanisms among participants in the network==
- contracts include *storage deals*, in which clients pay FIL currency to miners in exchange for storing the specific file data that clients request
-

# Terraform  
*Allows you to manage your infrastructure through configuration files, rather than GUI*

Build, change, and manage your infrastructure in a safe, consistent, and repeatable way

By defining configs as version, reuse, and share

-   Define resources and infrastructure in human-readable, declarative config files

## Advantages:
-   Manage infrastructure on multiple cloud platforms
-   The human-readable configuration language helps you write infrastructure code quickly
-   Terraform state allows you to track resource changes throughout your deployments
-   Terraform plugins called providers let terraform interact with cloud platform
-   Commit configs to version control to safely collaborate

#### The problem *isn't*:
- classes
    - benign, but not good
- performance
    - C is very fast
- abstraction
- aesthetics
    - they do matter:
        - elegance
        - simplicity
        - flexibility
        - readability
        - maintainability

# Procedural > OOP
- imperative has no ability to handle shared state
- myfunc()

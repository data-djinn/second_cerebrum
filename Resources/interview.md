- I am motivated and passionate about data engineering, because I have seen the value it adds to organizations (full FTE-size value!)

  - tell a happy story about how you are improving but still not there yet

## What is your biggest achievement?

- keep it relevant (within the last 3 years)

## Why do you want to work with us?
- *there will be someone more experienced than you interviewing for this role*

## A time where you failed or made a mistake
- leaving Carlos without any work product before his meeting with CDP leadership
- just joined a big new project, and did not meet the commitments i had set earlier
- learned that it was better to over-communicate rather than undercommunicate

## Questions for me?
- what are the challenges that your business will face in the next 3-5 years?

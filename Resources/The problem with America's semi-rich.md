- huge % of wealth ammassed by the 0.1%
- but what of the 9.9%?
	- this segment is where I will most likely reside
- [_The 9.9 percent: The New Aristocracy That Is Entrenching Inequality and Warping Our Culture_](https://www.amazon.com/dp/B08VJNPMWM/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1&ascsubtag=[]vx[p]22437646[s]pocket-newtab[t]w[r]getpocket.com/recommendations[d]D).
## New American Aristocracy
### wants:
- hyper-focused on getting their kids into great schools & getting themselves into great jobs
- williong to work super-long hours
- want to live in great neighborhoods
	- even if that means keeping others out (fucking NIMBYs)
### believes:
- believe in meritocracy, that they've gained their positions in society by talent & hard work
	- main measures being educational attainment and material well-being
	- anything we provide to society on top or on the side of that is a reflection of our own virtue and not necessary
- believe in markets
- a good career is something white-collar and managerial
- believe their wealth is not enough
- recognize that american society is becoming haves vs. have-nots
	- **determined to not become a have-not**


### Who are they?
- less an income segment and more a culture (NIMBYs, WASPs)
- cultural construct that is defined by attitudes towards family
- have kids late, and invest heavily in them
	- nannies, schools, extracurriculars
	- driven by the intuition that the meritocratic game is getting harder
	- lack of imagination limits ability to deveate from the beaten path
		- private nannies --> private school --> name-brand college --> managerial position
	- harmful to people who don't make it, and harmful to the people that do
		- points to increases in anxiety disorders and unhappiness amongst the well-off
		- ?? what are the alternatives?
	
- Upper class culture & inequality not "chicken or the egg", but self-reinforcing feedback loop
- inequality is structural (capitalism)
	- balance of power tilts towards the capitalists
- culture of meritocracy serves as justification
- pervasive culture even in the lower middle class neuters political & cultural opposition

[[Data Management]]
- Data managers need to see data as a social system, embedded not just in the systems but in the people
- Successful people know how to use organizational data - what are stored where, how to retrieve them, and how to put them together

### Problems with organizational data management systems
**Redundancy** Same data are stored in different systems
**Lack of data control** Data are poorly managed
**Poor interface** Data are difficult to access
**Delays** There are frequently delays following requests for reports
**Lack of reality** Data management systems do not reflect the complexity of the real world
**Lack of data integration** Data are dispersed across different systems

Managers must make more decisions more rapidly. They cannot afford to wait for
programmers to write special-purpose programs to retrieve data and format
reports. They expect their questions to be answered rapidly, often within a day

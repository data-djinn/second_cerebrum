## Classes
- template for the creation of object instances
```scala
class Person(var name: String, var vocation: String)
class Book(var title: String, var author: String, var year: Int)
class Movie(var name: String, var director: String, var year: Int)

val p = Person("Rodney F Mullen", "Skateboarder")

// access fields with dot notation
p.name  // "Rodney F Mullen"
p.vocation  // "Skateboarder"

// since class params are var fileds, we can mutate them
p.name = "Tony Hawk"
p.vocation = "Skate God"
```
- parameters can be either mutabel `var` or immutable `val`

- classes can also have methods & additional fields that are not part of constructors
	- defined in the body of the class

```scala
class Person(var firstName: String, var lastName: String):

// initialization begins
  val fullName = firstName + " " + lastName

  // a class method
  def printFullName: Unit =
    // access the `fullName` field, which is created above
    println(fullName)

  printFullName
// initialization ends
```

- class constructor parameters can also have default values
```scala
class Socket(val timeout: Int = 5_000, val linger: Int = 5_000):
  override def toString = s"timeout: $timeout, linger: $linger"

// lets users of your code create classes in a variety of different ways
val s = Socket()  // timeout: 5000, linger: 5000
val s = Socket(2_500)  // timeout: 2500, linger: 5000
val s = Socket(10_000, 10_000)  //timeou: 10000, linger: 10000
val s = Socket(timeout = 10_000)  // timout: 10000, linger: 5000
val s = Socket(linger = 10_0000)  // timout: 5000, linger: 10000
```

#### Auxiliary constructors
- define a class to have multiple constructors so consumers of your class can build it in different ways

```scala
import java.time.*

// [1] the primary constructor
class Student(
  var name: String,
  var govtId: String
):
  private var _applicationDate: Option[LocalDate] = None
  private var _studentId: Int = 0

  // [2] a constructor for when the student has completed
  // their application
  def this(
    name: String,
    govtId: String,
    applicationDate: LocalDate
  ) =
    this(name, govtId)
    _applicationDate = Some(applicationDate)

  // [3] a constructor for when the student is approved
  // and now has a student id
  def this(
    name: String,
    govtId: String,
    studentId: Int
  ) =
    this(name, govtId)
    _studentId = studentId
```

## Objects
- class that has exactly one instance (singleton)
- evaluated lazily when its members are referenced
- objects in scala enable grouping methods and fields under one namespace, similar to `@staticmethod` in python
```scala
object StringUtils:
  def truncate(s: String, length: Int): String = s.take(length)
  def containsWhitespace(s: String): Boolean = s.matches(".*\\s.*")
  def isNullOrEmpty(s: String): Boolean = s == null || s.trim.isEmpty

StringUtils.truncate("Chuck Bartowski", 5) // "Chuck"

import StringUtils.{truncate, containsWhiteSpace, isNullOrEmpty}  // use * to import all 
truncate("Chuck Bartowski", 5) // "Chuck"
containsWhitespace("Sarah Walker") // true 
isNullOrEmpty("John Casey") // false

// objects can also contain fields, which are also accessed like static members:
object MathConstants {
	val PI = 3.14159
	val E = 2.71828
}

println(MathConstants.PI)  // 3.14159
```

## Companion objects
- ==an `object` that has the same name as a class, & is declared in the same file as the class==
	- corresponding class is called the object's *companion class*
	- like a static method in python
- a companion class or object can access the private members of its companion
- used for methods and values that are not specific to instances of the companion class
	- e.g.: `Circle` has a member named `area` which is specific to each instance
	- companion object has a **method that's not specific to a class instance, and is available to every instance**
```scala
import scala.math._

class Circle(val radius: Double) {
	def area: Double = Circle.calculateArea(radius)
}

object Circle {
	private def calculateArea(radius: Double): = Pi * pow(radius, 2.0)
} // because calculateArea is private, it can't be accessed by other code

val circle1 = new Circle(5.0)
circle1.area 
```
#### Useful for:
- static methods under a shared namespace
	- methods can be public or private
	- if `calculateArea` was public, it would be accessed as `Circle.calculateArea`
- can contain **`apply` methods**: ==factory methods to construct new instances==
- can also contain **`unapply` methods**: ==used to deconstruct objects== (such as with pattern matching)
```scala
class Person {
  var name = ""
  var age = 0
  override def toString = s"$name is $age years old"
}

object Person {
  // a one-arg factory method
  def apply(name: String): Person = {
    var p = new Person
    p.name = name
    p
  }

  // a two-arg factory method
  def apply(name: String, age: Int): Person = {
    var p = new Person
    p.name = name
    p.age = age
    p
  }
}

val joe = Person("Joe")
val fred = Person("Fred", 29)

//val joe: Person = Joe is 0 years old
//val fred: Person = Fred is 29 years old
```

## Traits
- similar to an interface in [Java]
- can contain:
	- abstract methods & fields
	- concrete methods & fields
- can be used as an interface, defining only abstract members that will be implemented by other classes
```scala
trait Employee {
	def id: Int
	def firstName: String
	def lastName: String
}

// traits can also contain concrete members
trait HasLegs {
	def numLegs: Int  // abstract
	def walk(): Unit  // abstract
	def stop() = println("Stopped walking")  // concrete method
}

trait HasTail {
	def tailColor: String
	def wagTail() = println("Tail is wagging")
	def stopTail() = println("Tail is stopped")
}
```
- note how each trait only handles very specific attributes & behaviors: `HasLegs` deals only with legs, and `HasTail` deals only with tail-related functionality
	- Traits let you build small modules like this
- later in your code, classes can mix multiple traits to build larger components:
```scala
class IrishSetter(name: String) extends HasLegs, HasTail:
  val numLegs = 4
  val tailColor = "Red"
  def walk() = println("Iâ€™m walking")
  override def toString = s"$name is a Dog"

// IrishSetter class implements the abstract methods that are defined in HasLegs & HasTail
val d = new IrishSetter("Big Red") // "Big Red is a Dog"
```

## Abstract Classes
- better to use than traits when:
	- you want a base class that takes constructor arguments
	- the code will be caled from Java code

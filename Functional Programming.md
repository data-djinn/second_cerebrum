- must companies struggle with code fragility/complexity
	- every new feature that gets added to the code increases its complexity, which then increases the chance that somethnig will break
	- software often grows so complex that the developers avoid changing it more than is absolutely necessary, for fear of breaking something
	- many companies employ whole teams of developers to just keep existing systems going
- trajectory of the current software industry is towards increasing complexity, longer product-development times, and a greater fragility of production systems
- rather than just throwing more people at the problem, the answer is ==functional programming==
